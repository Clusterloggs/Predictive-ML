# Bank Loan Prediction with Machine Learning using Python

This project aims to predict loan approvals using machine learning techniques. By leveraging Python's machine learning libraries and MySQL integration, we analyze historical loan data to build predictive models.

## Introduction

In this project, we utilize machine learning algorithms to predict whether a bank loan application will be approved or denied. By analyzing past data and training our models, I aim to provide insights that can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions.

## Features

- Integration with MySQL database for data retrieval.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Preprocessing techniques including data cleaning and feature engineering.
- Training various machine learning models for loan prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics.
- Deployment strategies for integrating the model into real-world applications.

## Required Packages
